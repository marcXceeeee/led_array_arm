led_array_arm
=============
- An implementation of an RGB LED array driver for the LPC1769 microcontroller, using the LPCXpressor dev. kit.
- The RGB LED array that was used for this project can be obtained here: http://www.adafruit.com/products/420 .
- More information about the LPCeXpressor dev. kit is here: http://www.lpctools.com/lpc1768.lpcxpresso.aspx . This board is cheap ($30), has loads of GPIO, and has a fast ARM Cortex-M3 core (can clock up to 120 MHz).
